/// A QA / approver decision on a specific work-item for a specific

/// they're attached to the work item, not the candidate. The promotion gate
/// evaluator (PR3) reads this table to decide whether the active candidate
/// can transition to Approved under WorkItemsOnly / WorkItemsAndManual modes.
///
/// One signoff per work item is enough (MVP). The unique index on
/// (WorkItemKey, Product, TargetEnv, ApproverEmail) holds a single row per user per work item;
/// re-deciding (Approve ↔ Block, say) updates that row in place rather than appending, so
/// <see cref="UpdatedAt"/> is the only trace of the earlier value on the row itself — the audit
/// log keeps the full sequence. Multi-approver-per-work-item is a future policy.
